Feb 10Are you sitting here feeling like you missed #Cardano? You haven't, it's still early.

In addition, think ahead. Figure out what the next big thing will be. Hint - it's what will be built on Cardano.

This is what I did when I felt like I missed #Bitcoin. It's how I found $ADA.

Feb 7 Cardano $ADA was the first crypto I bought in 2017. Held it way too long, finally capitulated. Restarted a bag at $0.20 & bought most of my bag, God as my witness, at around $0.04.

Seeing it headed straight for $1, WORTH IT   $4 gives me a 100X

Feb 3Today at 20:20:16 UTC (the next testnet epoch rollover) we’ll hard fork the #Cardano Testnet & apply the #Goguen native token upgrade (aka ‘Mary’ ), transforming it into a multi-asset network. Next comes mainnet, targeted for the end of February. Onward.

Feb 3Dear #Ethereum community, if the increased Gas fees killing you, it's time to move to the #Cardano network as #Goguen is coming. 
With #cardano, ERC20 converter Dapps can smoothly move from the Ethereum network to Cardano.

Beautiful S/R flip at the 950 sats levels with continuation towards the next region 1325-1400 sats.

Jan 25I will be moving my $ada #cardano delegation from any pool who has more then two pools running. I see a lot of people making pools 1000-150000 and it isn’t good for the decentralization of the network and greed tends to kick in as price rises.

Jan 22Less than three weeks ago #Cardano was $0.20. 

Today $ADA recovered “back” to $0.34. 

In three months after another dip, it’ll recover “back” between $0.60 - $0.80. 

It’s all about perspective. Zoom out. HODL. Remind yourself of the fundamentals. Free your mind.

Jan 17We just passed 3400 new #ADA wallets, 40 min to go then stats will be up.

These 3400 wallets want ADA, where to buy? 

These ADA's getting more expensive with so many hodling and staking their ADA. 

Most not want to sell their ADA.

Jan 16#Cardano community has the smartest crypto community on Twitter. 

#Bitcoin would be #2. 

Impressive, given that Cardano's current market cap is a fraction of Bitcoin's.

It doesn't take a genius to see that this ecosystem and the #ADA coin are going to be growing very rapidly.

Imagine #Cardano that has fast and cheap transactions, more secure #dApps, working #PoS, and the best #staking.

Coinbase is in 17th place doing about $1.29 Billion annually. 

Shouldn't we first ask for the bigger exchanges to list ADA?

Like for instance INDOEX, BITOFFER and BITASSET?

Dec 30, 2020One of the platforms that will do well in coming quarter, I think will be #Cardano. 

Majors are probably running first and this is definitely a major.

As long as $0.11 holds (or $0.15), I think we'll continue towards $0.27 and/or $0.40.

Dec 30, 2020#Cardano is a smart contract platform that will be here in 2025, 2035, and even also in 2050. It is built to be sustainable in the long term and due to the governance model people will be in charge to decide.

Cardano is an ideal platform for #decentralized applications.

Dec 5, 2020The future is unprecedented, so as Ethereum transitions to proof of stake. 

and y’all want to lock your funds in order to stake #ETH until phase 1, that may in fact take years. Go figure 

Another reason to choose #Cardano $ADA, where your funds aren’t locked while staking.

- Went $.13 to $.46 in less than 3 days (Dec 14th to Dec 16th)
- Went $.37 to $1.31 in less than 7 days (Dec 28th to Jan 3rd)

Nov 2, 2020A moment to reflect, as we reach an important milestone in #Cardano's decentralization journey. Exactly 50% of blocks are now being minted by community stake pools. Halfway there.

PS Better still, come Friday (when d =0.48) the 
@Cardano

Nov 2, 2020The D parameter is set to 0,5. It means that 50% of blocks are produced by pool operators. We should reach 100% in Q1 2021. From that time, #Cardano will be fully #decentralized, and under the control of the community. Nobody will be able to stop or censor Cardano #blockchain.

Sep 28, 2020In the latest AMA, Charles said that we will see the first project that will migrate from #Ethereum to #Cardano soon. Smart contract developers must satisfy the user's needs and decentralized services must be fast and cheap. This move is smart and more projects will likely do it.

Sep 23, 2020The current status of the #Cardano main-net:

- Over 50% of $ADA coins in the circulation are used for #staking. We expect that 20%-30% of coins will be added.

- SPOs create over 33% of blocks. It will be more in every epoch.

- No major issue from the start of the main-net.

Sep 23, 2020A little over two hours from now, we'll be in #Cardano Epoch 219. Which means a new, lower d. Which means more #decentralization. 

Which means, in the next epoch, community pools will take responsibility for a little over 1/3 (34%) of all block production. Onwards...

Aug 23, 2020#Cardano has the best #blockchain technology in #crypto. It does not mean that the price of $ADA will reflect it immediately. The capitalization does not necessarily reflect technology but rather adoption. People must first adopt and use Cardano on a daily basis.

Aug 19, 2020#Cardano has max supply of coins set to 45,000,000,000 $ADA. Currently circulates ~26,000,000,000. It is ~57%.

We have seen many projects that have only a few 10% of circulating coins.

ADA is a precious asset and we expect a high demand soon due to #staking and new features.

Jul 27, 2020In the #Cardano #PoS the majority of $ADA coins will be staked and owners are motivated not to sell them on the market since it is better to regularly earn new coins. It will make pressure on the price of coins since they will be very scarce. It is easier to speculate in #PoW.

Jul 27, 2020IMPORTANT NOTE!

NEVER send REAL $ADA from a Mainnet wallet to a Testnet wallet. You will lose your ada!

Testnet ada comes from a snapshot & wallet restore.

If you don't understand this - it is best to avoid the testnet and wait for Shelley Mainnet!

Jul 26, 2020A few facts about #Cardano #staking:

- No minimum is defined. You can stake 1 $ADA.
- You can delegate coins via Daedalus or Yoroi wallets.
- Coins never leave wallets. You can always use them.
- You get a reward every 5 days.
- Rewards depend on the performance of pools.

Jul 22, 2020Only a few days left to the hard-fork that will take #Cardano to the Shelley era. Besides the rise of #DeFi, it will probably be one of the most important #crypto events in 2020. Cardano will be ready to step into DeFi in 2021 and can bring a new level of quality and security.

Jul 21, 2020It is expected that in 2020, 1B users will use smartphones for payments. If only 1% from it used the #Cardano network and TX fee was $0,01 then the network would earn ~$330,000 a day. The network rewards $ADA stake-holders so everybody can profit from the network success.

Jul 21, 2020#Litecoin is an alternative to #Bitcoin so it can be called #altcoin. Besides a few parameters, the projects are nearly the same.

#Cardano is not an alternative to Bitcoin since it will be faster, more decentralized, and more useful. It could be a new standard of the kind.

Jul 21, 2020#Cardano will probably be the first platform with fully functional #PoS, smart contracts, and the ability to issue tokens. 

The ERC-20 converter enables migration from #Ethereum to Cardano. Resolved scalability, secure smart contracts, and low fees are attractive features.

Jul 18, 2020People often hold $BTC since they believe the price will rise.

Holding $ADA has different qualities. #Cardano can ensure passive income so the price might remain stable or slowly rise and people will be happy. The advantage cannot be obvious now but it will be in the future.

- Nearly 1000 addresses are created every day.
- Google trends suggest the rising interest.
- The team collaborates with other teams, e.g. #Litecoin.
- More activity on social media
- People buy $ADA every day and volume is quite big.

Jul 3, 2020$ADA crossed $0,10.

We know it. #Cardano is pumping due to the great announcements and the #Coinbase listing effect.

We believe that once #staking will be available we do not see ADA below $0,10.

Anyway, there will be another announcement today.

#PoS improves the network properties with adoption. If Cardano succeeds as a network then stakeholders will profit.

May 31, 2020Cardano is back in the top 10. I would like to see #Cardano surpassing forked PoW projects. Let's hope it will happen and the #crypto market will be more rational. It makes no sense to have many projects without added value on top. Cardano deserves to be there.

It’s important to understand what the benefits are for ADA holders. In this post, we’ll look at how Cardano’s decentralization will benefit ADA holders.

Oct 5, 2018#Cardano is one of the top rated projects! The reason for it is both quality of the code as well as competence of its team. #EOS team could learn A LOT from #ADA – they rush and break things, while Cardano is taking a slow-and-steady approach. #Crypto is a marathon, not a race.
